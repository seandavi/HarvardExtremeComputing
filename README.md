Materials for the Fall 2015 Harvard Extreme Computing course.

## Lecture 1

This lecture will serve as a basic review of the 
core concepts of normal biology with a focus on the
current state of the understanding of the human
genome.

[Slides will be here soon]

## Lab 1

This lab will be run by the Research Computing group at Harvard and will cover:

1. Introduction to the R programming language
2. Accessing and using the Odyssey High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster

### Resources of interest

- [R statistical programming environment](http://www.r-project.org).
- [Introduction to Harvard's Odyssey cluster](https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/intro-to-odyssey/)

I have created some introductory materials here that you may use (not required) 
to augment what you do during the lab. The "lecture slides" are meant to be used "interactively" and
additional material is useful to get a sense of some of the basic capabilities of R.

- [Introduction to R](http://watson.nci.nih.gov/~sdavis/tutorials/IntroToR/)

### Getting started with R

1. Install the [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Consider installing [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) as a convenient environment for accessing R




## Lecture 2

We will continue our discussion of biological principles and begin
to delve more deeply into technologies that allow us to 
examine normal and disease biology at a molecular level. We will
also begin to discuss data analysis approaches to high-throughput
biological data analysis.

## Lab 2

In this lab, we will introduce a particularly important biological application, 
gene expression quantification and analysis.  I will introduce the technology, some
details about the data formats and primary data analysis.

Then, we will work with [the Bioconductor project](http://bioconductor.org) as
an environment for biological data analysis. Finally, I will introduce a tutorial RNA-seq
dataset that you will work through on your own.

## Lecture 3

This will be a combined lecture/lab.  I will introduce the "final project" in which 
you will partially reproduce the results of a recent paper published in Nature. 

## Lab 3

In this lab, we will finish up the actual "compute" of the final project and begin
to interpret and visualize the results of our computation.  

## Lecture 4

TBD....
